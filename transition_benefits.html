                    <p>Granite Alliance wants to provide you with the highest quality of care.  We understand that sometimes you are taking a medication that has different coverage on our formulary.  These medications may be non-formulary, have a quantity limit, or require prior authorization or step therapy.  In these situations, we have a process that will temporarily allow you to continue receiving the Medications that are covered by Medicare Part D.  This will give you time to talk with your prescriber to decide if you should switch to a different medication that is covered on the formulary or submit a request for a coverage determination or exception. The Transition Benefit applies for a 90-day period once certain circumstances occur.</p>
