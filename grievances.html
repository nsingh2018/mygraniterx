                    <h2>How to Make a Complaint (Grievance):</h2>
                    <h3>What is a grievance?</h3>
                    <p>A grievance is a complaint you file with Granite Alliance. If you contact us with a complaint, we will file a grievance on your behalf.</p>
                    <p>Your complaint (or grievance) could be about any of the following types of items:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are unhappy with the quality of care you received</li>
                        <li>You believe someone did not respect your privacy or shared your information</li>
                        <li>You are unhappy with the customer service you received</li>
                        <li>You experienced long wait times for the pharmacist or on the phone with Customer Service</li>
                        <li>You are unhappy with the service received at or cleanliness of the pharmacy</li>
                        <li>You believe the information we provided was hard to understand</li>
                        <li>You believe we were not timely in our decision-making process</li>
                        <li>Any other type of issue that may cause you concern</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What is not considered a grievance?</h3>
                    <p>If you are looking for approval on coverage of a medication, that would be considered a <a target="_blank" id="coverage_determination_link" href="https://www.nsingh2018.github.io/mygraniterx/coverage_determinations">Coverage Determination</a>. If you have already requested a Coverage Determination and it was denied, you are then able to submit an Appeal or a Redetermination. These processes themselves would not be considered a grievance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How do I file a grievance?</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to file a complaint up to 60 days after the event has occurred. There are several ways that you can contact us to file a grievance. You can also use these methods if you wish to request an aggregate number of grievances, appeals, and exceptions filed with Granite Alliance.</p>
                    <h3>By Phone:</h3>
                    <p>Generally, we recommend contacting Customer Service directly so a representative can work with you to resolve any concerns you may have. To file your grievance by phone, please call Customer Care at:</p>
                    1-855-586-2573 (TTY: 711), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
                    <h3>By Fax or Mail:</h3>
                    <p>You may also put your complaint in writing and send it to us. In your complaint please include the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your Name</li>
                        <li>Your Address</li>
                        <li>Your Phone Number</li>

                                <li>Include the date that the incident occured along with an explanation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Your Signature</li>
                        <li>If your Appointed Representative is filing a grievance on your behalf, also include a completed Appointment of Representative Form. This form can be found <a target="_blank" id="appointment_of_representative" href="https://www.nsingh2018.github.io/mygraniterx//mygraniterx/static/assets/CMS%20_1696_English_2018Final508.pdf">here.</a></li>

                    <h3>What is a grievance</h3>
                    <p>A grievance is any complaint or dispute, expressing dissatisfaction with any aspect of the operations, activities, or behavior of our organization, regardless of whether or not you request remedial action be taken. A grievance may also include a complaint regarding a refusal to expedite a coverage determination or redetermination. Grievances may include complaints regarding the timeliness, appropriateness, access to, and/or setting of a provided item. Grievances do not involve problems related to approving or paying for Part D drugs or a Low Income Subsidy (LIS) or Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) determination (See Appeal section).</p>

    <h3 id="filegrievance">How to file a Grievance</h3>
    <p>You would file a grievance if you have a complaint regarding us or one of our network pharmacies. For example, you would file a grievance if you have a complaint about things such as wait times when filling a prescription, rude behavior by a network pharmacist or other staff, problems with the customer service you receive, and difficulty getting or understanding information you need or request.</p>
    <p>If you have a grievance, we encourage you to call our Member Services department immediately. We will make every attempt to resolve your grievance over the phone. You may file your grievance by phone, mail or fax. You have the option to request an expedited or “fast” grievance process if Granite Alliance refused to expedite a coverage determination or redetermination and you have not yet purchased or received the drug in dispute. We will notify you of the decision within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of your grievance.</p>
    <p>Your grievance must be submitted within sixty (60) calendar days of the event or incident. We must address your grievance as quickly as your case requires based on your health status, but no later than thirty (30) calendar days after receiving your grievance. We may extend the time frame by up to fourteen (14) days if you ask for the extension, or if we can justify a need for additional information and the delay is in your best interest. Once a decision has been rendered regarding your grievance we will respond to you in writing if you file a written grievance, request a written response, or you grievance is related to your quality of care. If a grievance was requested over the phone we will notify you of the decision orally.</p>
    <p>If we deny your grievance in whole or in part, our written decision will explain why we denied it, and will tell you about any dispute resolution options you may have.</p>
    <h3 id="complaints">For Complaints about Quality of Care</h3>
    <p>Complaints concerning the quality of care received under Medicare may be made verbally or in a written format through Granite Alliance’s grievance process.  Complaints can also be made to an independent organization called the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO). For example, if you believe your pharmacist provided the incorrect dose or quantity of a prescription, you may file a complaint with the QIO in addition to or in lieu of a complaint filed under our grievance process. Granite Alliance will work with the QIO to resolve any complaint filed directly with the QIO.</p>
